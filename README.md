# Acquisition-of-Social-Media-Data-and-Sentiment-Analysis

Data and code for my project "Acquisition of Social Media Data and Sentiment Analysis"

## Introduction

With the continuous progress of Internet technology and the popularization of intelligent mobile devices, social media has become an indispensable part of people's daily life. The status updates, comments, Weibo and other short text content posted by users on social media platforms not only reflect their immediate emotions and attitudes, but also contain rich social information. Emotion analysis, as an important branch of natural language processing, aims to identify and extract emotional tendencies in text, and has significant application value in areas such as enterprise brand monitoring, market trend analysis, and public opinion monitoring.

## Problem Background

The development of social media: The rapid rise of social media platforms has led to an explosive growth in the amount of user generated content (UGC). These short texts have a large amount of information and fast update speed, making it a challenge to effectively extract valuable information from them.
The Importance of Sentiment Analysis: Sentiment analysis can help businesses understand consumers' attitudes towards products or services, providing a basis for marketing strategies; Meanwhile, government agencies can monitor online public opinion through sentiment analysis and respond promptly to social events.
The difficulty of short text analysis: Social media short texts have the characteristics of non-standard language, diverse expressions, and complex emotional tendencies, which bring many difficulties to sentiment analysis.

## Problem Statement

Although social media short text sentiment analysis has broad application prospects, it faces the following core issues: difficulty in data preprocessing, lack of targeted sentiment dictionaries, low accuracy in sentiment recognition, insufficient multimodal sentiment analysis, and difficulty in capturing sentiment evolution trends. This study aims to propose effective sentiment analysis methods to address these issues.

## Aim of the Project

Build a crawler system to selectively obtain data from social media or new media websites such as Weibo, Zhihu, Xiaohongshu, etc. Train a model using existing data, and then perform sentiment analysis using natural language processing algorithms.

## Objectives of the Project

Crawler system: at least two-thirds of Weibo, Zhihu, Xiaohongshu or other new media websites, as they plan to build cross platform tracking.

Public opinion analysis: including common deep learning based data analysis such as sentiment analysis and multi class sentiment analysis, as well as common statistical analysis and visualization such as word clouds.

## Scopes of the Project:

This project does not include sentiment analysis of long texts or non social media texts.

The project does not involve sentiment analysis of voice or video data.

Excluding the work of developing mobile applications or user interfaces.

The results of the project will only be validated on specific social media platforms and cannot guarantee validity on other platforms.

## Expected Contribution of the Project

Build a crawler system that can crawl Weibo and Xiaohongshu, and crawl relevant data based on themes.

Develop an efficient data preprocessing tool that can automatically process short text data for specific platforms.

Develop an sentiment analysis model that achieves predetermined accuracy metrics on the test set.

Provide an emotional trend report showcasing key emotional changes monitored during the project period.
